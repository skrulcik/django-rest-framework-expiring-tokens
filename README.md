# Archived / Deprecated

This repository is no longer being updated or supported. Please consider using the community-supported [GetBlimp/django-rest-framework-jwt](https://github.com/GetBlimp/django-rest-framework-jwt) instead.

_Why archive?_ This fork was created for a small use application that no longer uses it. There doesn't seem to be any community interest in it (the JWT option seems strictly better), so I'd rather archive this and label it as unsupported than feel responsible for keeping it up to date and its dependencies secure.

# Expiring Tokens for Django Rest Framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skrulcik/drf-expiring-tokens.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skrulcik/drf-expiring-tokens)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/skrulcik/drf-expiring-tokens/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/skrulcik/drf-expiring-tokens?branch=master)
[![Requirements Status](https://requires.io/github/skrulcik/drf-expiring-tokens/requirements.svg?branch=master)](https://requires.io/github/skrulcik/drf-expiring-tokens/requirements/?branch=master)

This package provides a lightweight extension to the included token
authentication in [Django Rest
Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/), causing tokens to expire
after a specified duration.

This behaviour is good practice when using token authentication for production
APIs.

If you require more complex token functionality, you're probably better off
looking at one of the OAuth2 implementations available for Django Rest
Framework, or
[django-rest-framework-jwt](http://getblimp.github.io/django-rest-framework-jwt/).

This package was forked from the unmaintained
[django-rest-framework-expiring-tokens](https://github.com/JamesRitchie/django-rest-framework-expiring-tokens)
, which was inspired by this [Stack Overflow
answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15380732).

## Installation

Expiring Tokens is tested against the latest versions of Django 1.11 LTS and
the 2.0 release, and Django Rest Framework 3.7.7.

Grab the package from PyPI.

```zsh
pip install drf-expiring-tokens
```

As this package uses a proxy model on the original Token model, the first step
is to setup the default
[TokenAuthentication](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#tokenauthentication)
scheme, and check that it works.

Then, add the package to `INSTALLED_APPS` along with `rest_framework.authtoken`
in `settings.py`.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    'drf_expiring_tokens',
    ...
]
```

Specify the desired lifespan of a token with `EXPIRING_TOKEN_LIFESPAN` in
`settings.py` using a [timedelta
object](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects).  If
not set, the default is 90 minutes.

By default, tokens will be reset every time a new login occurs. By setting
`ALWAYS_RESET_TOKEN` to `False`, this behavior can be deactivated.

```python
import datetime
EXPIRING_TOKEN_LIFESPAN = datetime.timedelta(hours=2)
ALWAYS_RESET_TOKEN = False
```

[Set the authentication scheme](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#setting-the-authentication-scheme) to `drf_expiring_tokens.authentication.ExpiringTokenAuthentication`
on a default or per-view basis.

If you used the `obtain_auth_token` view, you'll need to replace it with the  `obtain_expiring_auth_token` view in your URLconf.

```python
from drf_expiring_tokens import views
urlpatterns += [
    url(r'^api-token-auth/', views.obtain_expiring_auth_token)
]
```

If using Django 1.7 or later, you'll need to run `migrate`, even though nothing
is changed, as Django requires proxy models that inherit from models in an
app with migrations to also have migrations.

```zsh
python manage.py migrate
```

## Usage

Expiring Tokens works exactly the same as the default TokenAuth, except that using an expired token will return a response with an HTTP 400 status and a `Token has expired` error message.

The `obtain_expiring_auth_token` view works exactly the same as the `obtain_auth_token` view, except it will replace existing tokens that have expired with a new token.

## Improvements

 * Variable token lifespans.
 * Possibly change `obtain_expiring_auth_token` to always replace an existing token. (Configurable?)
 * South Migrations
